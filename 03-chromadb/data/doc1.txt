Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way.
Definition and Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) combines computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics to facilitate interactions between computers and humans using natural language. It encompasses a range of techniques that allow machines to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data, enabling them to perform tasks such as translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.
