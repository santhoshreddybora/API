Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems built on deep neural networks designed to process, understand and generate human-like text. By using massive datasets and billions of parameters, LLMs have transformed the way humans interact with technology. It learns patterns, grammar and context from text and can answer questions, write content, translate languages and many more. Mordern LLMs include ChatGPT (OpenAI), Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, etc

LLM
To explore the technical concepts behind LLMs, understand how they work, what they can do and how to build projects using them, refer to our Large Language Model (LLM) Tutorial.

Working of LLM
LLMs are primarily based on the Transformer architecture which enables them to learn long-range dependencies and contextual meaning in text. At a high level, they work through:

Working
Input Embeddings: Converting text into numerical vectors.
Positional Encoding: Adding sequence/order information.
Self-Attention: Understanding relationships between words in context.
Feed-Forward Layers: Capturing complex patterns.
Decoding: Generating responses step-by-step.
Multi-Head Attention: Parallel reasoning over multiple relationships.

Architecture
The architecture of LLMs consist of multiple stacked layers that process text in parallel. Core components include:

Embedding Layer: Converts tokens i.e words/subwords into dense vectors.
Attention Mechanism: Learns context by focusing on relevant words.
Feed-Forward Layers: Capture non-linear patterns and relationships.
Normalization and Residual Connections: Improve training stability.
Output Layer: Generates predictions such as the next word or sentence.
